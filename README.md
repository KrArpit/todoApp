# React Todo Application

This project is a simple and intuitive Todo application built using React. It allows users to add, update, delete, and filter tasks based on their status (all, pending, or completed). This application was created as a part of my learning journey into React, where I explored the basics of React, the Context API, custom hooks, and state management.

## Features

- **Add Todos:** Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Update Todos:** Edit the task title and update your todo list.
- **Delete Todos:** Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **Toggle Status:** Mark tasks as completed or pending with a simple click.
- **Filter Tasks:** View all tasks, only pending tasks, or only completed tasks.
- **Persistent State:** Todo list data is saved to `localStorage` and persists across sessions.

## Learning Experience

This project was a great opportunity to learn and practice essential React concepts. Key learnings include:

- **Context API:** Implemented the Context API to manage and provide state across multiple components without prop drilling.
- **React Hooks:** Learned how to create and use custom hooks for managing state and effects in functional components.
- **State Management:** Gained hands-on experience in managing component state, including adding, updating, and deleting items in a list.
